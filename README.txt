Yomiassist
==========

Yomiassist is a utility to produce Kindle-ready and learner-friendly formatted ebooks. 
It is still an early work in progress, but currently it will:

 * Identify best-guess readings for kanji appearing in a source text, and display them as furigana
 * Display kanji-reading-definition footnotes on each page
 * Filter displayed furigana and footnotes according to reading level
 * Produce a PDF output optimized for reading on a Kindle
 
It does not (and probably never will) format text vertically.

Yomiassist requires the wkhtmltopdf utility to be installed, and currently should work on OS X and Linux. 
Windows support should be possible but is not currently implemented.
